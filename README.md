# RomanNumConversion
This program has two functions: one that converts Roman numerals to normal numbers and the other one, vice versa.

Input has to be a string and a string is returned.

The conversion only works for numbers (in both numeral systems) for numbers greater than 0 and less than 4000; this is the result of Roman numerals having bars over the numbers for values 4000 and after, which gives rise to an character encoding problem. 

Perhaps that can be dealth with, but there is also the issue of having to put too many entries into the conversion dictionaries, which can also possibly be dealt with in a more efficient manner, but for now, these define the limits of this program.
